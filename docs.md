## Automated Workflow

This repository includes an automated workflow defined in `.github/workflows/main.yml`. Below are the key steps and updates related to the workflow:

1. **Job Execution**:
   - The `set -euo pipefail` command ensures the script exits on errors, treats unset variables as errors, and propagates pipeline errors.
   - During execution, the workflow calculates and logs the diff size using `wc -c` to display the byte count.

2. **Model API Integration**:
   - The workflow calls a model API endpoint using `curl`.
   - Enhancements include:
     - The addition of a log message: `"Calling model API..."` prior to the API call.
     - Improved `curl` options:
       - `--fail`: Ensures curl exits with an error on HTTP codes â‰¥ 400.
       - `--no-progress-meter`: Suppresses the progress bar for cleaner logs.
       - `--max-time 120`: Limits the API call to 120 seconds.

3. **Payload Handling**:
   - The POST request uses the `@payload.json` file as input data.
   - The API output is redirected to `response.json` for further processing.

The workflow is optimized for reliability and detailed logging to facilitate debugging and ensure smooth API interactions.
